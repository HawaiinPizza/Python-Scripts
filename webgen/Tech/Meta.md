# How the sasuage is made
This is tech used to make the blog.

- Markdown from David Parson: to convert markdown fiels to html.
- Static Website generation: Since /g/ would get mad at me for using something like jinja or hugo, I made my own.
- Github pages: Free hosting YES. At some point, once the blog actually becomes meaningful to me, I'll host it someplace else.
